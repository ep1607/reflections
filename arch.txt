x86
is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures
		  |___can work with input generated by an older product or technology such as a legacy system
The architecture has been implemented in processors from Intel, Cyrix, AMD, VIA 

Today, x86 is ubiquitous in both stationary and portable personal computers, and is also used in midrange computers, workstations, servers...

A large amount of software, including operating systems (OSs) such as DOS, Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris and Mac OS X, functions with x86-based hardware

The x86 architecture is a variable instruction length, primarily "CISC" design with emphasis on backward compatibility
